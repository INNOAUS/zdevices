zdevices Bylaws
===============

Goals
-----

The principal goal is to collect examples of devices that can be reused and
improved by others.  It is a device wiki.

Overall Structure
-----------------

Repository is organized by language, and within each language, one directory
per independent project, which can hold as many devices as the author wishes.
Each project should be self-contained with:

* A README that explains the devices and how they work
* The necessary build scripts and/or instructions
* Sample configuration data as needed

Git Workflow
------------

The ZFL project uses no specific git workflow.  All committers work directly
on master.  The zdevices project makes no releases, and has no version number.

Contributions
-------------

All contributors are listed in AUTHORS.  All git committers agree in advance
that they license their contributions under the GPL, that they are the original
authors of their work, or that they can certify the origin of the code.

All packages are maintained by a single person, who is the responsible editor
for that package and who is named in the README as such.  This is usually the
originator of the package.  Whereas several people can collaborate on a package,
one single person is always the lead maintainer and the one to blame when it
breaks.
